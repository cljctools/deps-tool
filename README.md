# deps-tool
a tool allowing js- and -jvm languages to install clj/cljs/cljc + deps.edn code from github, like golang and clojure do 

[merged into https://github.com/cljctools/cljctools]

## deprecated

- practically clojure(script) libraries be used from js/jvm? yes, in theory, but practically - no
- functions return datastructures and core.async channels, that are not convinietly usable directly on jvm/js (well, from java they are, as all other classes, but no go blocks etc.)
- unless some insane layer of porting it back, which makes no sense
- development of apps and tools should be in parallel when different languages, clojure(script) having an advantage of having interoperabilty and being able to use libs directly


## rationale

- with golang and clojure we can require code direclty from github, for example
```clojure
{:deps {clj.native-image/clj.native-image
             {:git/url "https://github.com/taylorwood/clj.native-image.git"
              :sha "7708e7fd4572459c81f6a6b8e44c96f41cdd92d4"}}}
```
- now, we can write for example `cljctools/paredit` libary as `.cljc` and use it in our clojure(script) projects, just like golang does, awesome
- but how do javascript and jvm based project use our `foo/bar` library? 
- we could build two artifacts - jar and npm dist - and publish to `maven`, `clojars` AND `npm`
- we would need accounts, keys etc., which works
- but... we already see with golang that using code direclty from github and compiling it on site - Dockerfile or our OS - is less effiecient, but more freeing and makes writing code more enjoyable - any commit can be used as a dep
- we want a tool - a `deps-tool` - **to invite javascript and jvm people to the party we (clojure) and golang are already having**
- `deps-tool`:
  - is a cli tool, it is released to github releases (or better - is a bash script) that we download - in Dockerfile or our OS (just like a `lein`,`nodejs`, `npm`,...)
  - in our project (js or jvm based), we add a `deps.edn` and/or `deps-tool.edn` and specify - our project also depends on `github.com/foo/bar` clj/cljs/cljc lib 
  - we run the usual `npm install` or `mvn isntall` - we get our `node_modules` or `~/.m2`, nice
  - then we run `deps-tool install` - it does what `deps.edn` does, get the code etc., and also compiles the lib into a `.jar` or npm module and puts the artifact in `node_modules` or `~/.m2`
  - so clj/cljs/cljc code can be used direclty from github by js- jvm- based projects, a <ins>TWO WAY STREET</ins> ('cause we already can use npm/maven)
